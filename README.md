# IBM-Python-Project
Using Python to analyze and visualize historical stock data.

This project is from the IBM Coursera Course 'Python Project for Data Science' within the IBM Professional Certificate in Data Science.

In a Jupyter Notebook, we use 'yfinance', 'Pandas', 'requests', 'BeautifulSoup', and 'plotly' to extract, webscrape, clean, and visualize historical stock
data for Tesla and GameStop.
